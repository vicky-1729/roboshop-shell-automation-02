# roboshop-shell-automation-03
This project offers a fully automated setup for the RoboShop e-commerce application using Shell scripting. It provides scripts to install and configure all required services, components, and dependencies across multiple environments.

In this version of roboshop-shell-automation, the scripts have been improved using functions, loops, and best practices. This makes the code more efficient, modular, and easier to maintain.
