# roboshop-shell-automation-03
This project offers a fully automated setup for the RoboShop e-commerce application using Shell scripting. It provides scripts to install and configure all required services, components, and dependencies across multiple environments.

In this version of roboshop-shell-automation, the scripts have been enhanced by applying functions, loops, and best practices. The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is followed by utilizing a common file for shared logic, making the codebase more efficient, modular, and maintainable.
